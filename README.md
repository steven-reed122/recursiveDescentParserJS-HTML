This is a recursive descent parser, written in JS that employs HTML and CSS for a graphical interface.
To run it, open the rdparser-website.html file with google chrome.

This code should produce a series of tokens from the lexer, a parse-tree, 
the program translated to java code, and an error message if one is necessary.

For source-code and information look in the rdp-html folder.
To see the grammars utilized by this program, open the grammars.txt file.
For a valid test program to see what some code should look like, open the example_program.txt file.
To see current bugs with the code, look at the top of the rdparser.js file.
